#+TITLE: gitsync-nncp Manual

* Introduction
** Why it's here
** Operation Overview

branch names - like hostnames, no master

* Setup
** Making a new git repo

You can use =git init= like usual, but then rename the main/master branch to something unique for your machine; for instance, its hostname; for instance:

=git branch -m alice=

Now, we also need to create another branch that gitsync-nncp uses to track progress.  These branches begin with =gitsync-nncp/=.

=git branch gitsync-nncp/alice=



** Using an existing git repo
